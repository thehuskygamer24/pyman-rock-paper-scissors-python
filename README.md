# pyman-rock-paper-scissors python
## you need python version 3.13 and pip install random time requests
## a simple game of rock paper scissors made in python
# users may ignore this but should read
### if you decide to fork this and claim it as yours there will be trouble
### you can wait a while because im planning to make this project open source
### game is in early access with server connectivity that means you will need wifi for this thing to work
### i will eventually add offline mode in it 
## server trouble is resolved
## users can play the game and the server just runs on my computer i will need to start my computer for the server to work
## first problem with server what happens if my computer is turned off and someone is trying to connect to the game
### you will just need to contact me at discord for me to turn my computer on
### my computer hosts the game
### if you really want to play it you will need to create your own custom server for it (requires code to code a custom server for it and it is hard to do)
