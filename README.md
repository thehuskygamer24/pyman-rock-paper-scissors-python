# pyman-rock-paper-scissors python
## you need python version 3.13 and pip install random time requests colorama playsound==1.2.2 os
## a simple game of rock paper scissors made in python
# users may ignore this but should read
### if you decide to fork this and claim it as yours there will be trouble
### you can wait a while because im planning to make this project open source
### game is in early access with server connectivity that means you will need wifi for this thing to work
### i will eventually add offline mode in it 
## server trouble is finally resolved
## no problems with the server now
### game is hosted by my raspberry pi
### which should not cause problems unless the internet goes out on it or the gateway goes out
### the game should work without the localserver in this repo
### have fun
# UPDATE LOG FOR GAME 
## music and live server is here
### music will play before your match starts in pyman rps 
### and the game has a new working server
