# pyman-rock-paper-scissors python
## a simple game of rock paper scissors made in python

### game is in early access with server connectivity that means you will need wifi for this thing to work
### i will eventually add offline mode in it 
# VERY IMPORTANT
## this game currently does not have an active server meaning the game does not work
## if your good at python you can script your own custom server for it
## overwise it wont work i am trying to figure out how to get a server for it im thinking my raspberry pi
